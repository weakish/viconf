Usage
-----

Run:

    viconf command

Then `viconf` will open the config file for this command, and you can edit it.
And `viconf` will try to check the syntax before saving the file.

Update `viconf-updatedb` to update configure files from the upstream repo.
(Be careful, it will overrides your local changes.)

About
------

`viconf` solves the following problems for me:

- I cannot remembered where programs put their config file.
- I am too lazy to `man command` to look up the config file location.
- I often make typos when editing config files.
